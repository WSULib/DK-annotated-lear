When focusing on disability in the play like blindness and madness, this scene I think Shakespeare treats as a sane event. The servant, unlike other characters in the book, actually *see* what is happening to Gloucester and they fight for him because of how *mad* Cornwall's actions are. Throughout this scene we also see the servants hesitant to jump in and get involved in the situation but I think Shakespeare does that to mirror the audience and to show that if you truly cared and truly saw madness this is what you might do as normal people.
