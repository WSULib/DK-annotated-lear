Here, the King of France is professing his love and respect for Cordelia for being honest with her father. However, this line is particularly interesting because to say "this 'unprized precious' maid of me" is an oxymoron. Here, France is emphasizing that although Cordelia is no longer in her father's favor and titled with land, her character is what is most precious to him. However, there are many other ways in which the same message could have been portrayed here without the sentence contradicting itself. Yet, I find it interesting that Shakespeare made this literary choice. I would also like to note that throughout France's speech to Cordelia, there is a poetic rhyme scheme at the end of each line. --KÃ¤the Erichsen
