Flory: In the very literal sense, when using the word beard, Lear could be speaking about the hairs on his face. However, this could be read as his age being displayed for all people to see. Lear is asking if people are ashamed to know his age. The OED defines beard as (1D): allusively, of age, experience, virility. This can be applied to Shakespeare's use of beard here.
