Nilaj: the oed definition for "here" states:  "2a. In weakened sense, more or less directly indicating something present to the sight or the mind. Here is calls attention to what the speaker has, brings, offers, or discovers;" This is where we see Edmund opening his eyes for the first time to acknowledge that his position that he had in the beginning of the play is exactly the position he has at the end of the play. No matter how hard he tried to win the game of thrones, he still remained who he was since the beginning. When he says "I am here" it's almost as if he is talking to himself; telling himself that he has lost and that it is over. Just as the oed mentions, Edmund is in a state of weakness and he finally has sight of who he is.
