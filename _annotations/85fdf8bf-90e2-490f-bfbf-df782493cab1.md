Tristan Shaw: After Goneril and Regan greatly exaggerate their love for their father, Cordelia gives an honest answer about how much she loves Lear. She explains that her love is “according to my bond.” According to OED definition 7.a., a bond is “a uniting or cementing force or influence by which a union of any kind is maintained.” In one sense, Cordelia is bonded to Lear in a feudal relationship. She addresses him as “Your Majesty,” signaling that she is his respectful subject, and he is her king. In another sense, as daughter and father, Cordelia and Lear are also bonded by blood. Additionally, OED definition 6.b. defines “bond” as “Obligation, duty.” As a daughter and subject, Cordelia could mean that she has an obligation to love her father and king.
