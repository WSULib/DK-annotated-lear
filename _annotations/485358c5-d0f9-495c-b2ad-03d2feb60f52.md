The meaning of the word dowre according to the OED, adjective definition number one, is "hard, severe, bold, stern, fierce, hardy." Shakespeare uses this line to further emphasize the attitudes of the two sisters. This line is important in the play because it emphasizes the sisters feelings towards their father. They boldly try to impress their father by professing their love for him, then end up not caring for him the way they are supposed to. -Atalaya Adams
