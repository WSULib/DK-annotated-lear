An interesting aspect of these few lines is how short and to the point they are, and the fact that they do not follow iambic pentameter. For Cordelia to respond to Lear with one word after he expected so much more from her, by responding with a single word, it's just as jarring to the reader as it is to Lear. Shakespeare does a great job of putting the reader into the moment by allowing the audience to feel as Lear does.
