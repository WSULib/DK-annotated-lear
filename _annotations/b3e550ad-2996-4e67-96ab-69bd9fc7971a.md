Camaj: Gloucester is saying to Kent that Edmund is his son and that he has been responsible for his upbringing. Gloucester is embarrassed that Edmund is his son because he is a bastard, but in this quote, Gloucester says that he isn't embarrassed of saying that Edmund is his son anymore because he has had to acknowledge many times. Although Gloucester has a legitimate son, he says he loves both sons the same. This is important to the text because it shows the inequality of how Gloucester treats his sons.
