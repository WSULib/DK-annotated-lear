Gatzaros: Here Gloucester is being very dramatic in how he feels the Gods just play with humans like flies for sport. At this point in the play he had been blinded and now feels that everything is worthless. He believes there is no true justice in the world and that the universe is something for the Gods' own amusement. Gloucester is looking at the world as a dark place of torture when he speaks these lines to the old man. This line is very dramatic in the context of how Gloucester explains the world.
