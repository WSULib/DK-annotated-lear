This area of Edgar's transformation into Poor Tom is important to the play, because it gives a clear imagery and explanation of what the people of the time see "mad" people as and how they act. It serves as an excellent comparison to King Lear and a way for the audience to see King Lear's less transparent transition to madness. Edgar explains he's going to "grime his face" and "knot his hair" and "the winds and persecutions of the sky" will affect his face. This visual imagery shows that culturally being "mad" is as much internal as it is external. It means it is important while reading to consider how King Lear physical changes over the course of the play, as he is affected and worn down by the storms and weather conditions that he goes through in the play. This is as much true for the way Lear's speech changes over the course of the play as well, which is also listed in Edgar's transformation speech.
