Krajacic: OED definition 1A of Kibe states that a kibe is "a chapped or ulcerated chilblain."  According to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, chilblains are "small, itchy swellings on the skin that occur as a reaction to cold temperatures." They commonly occur around the foot. While the fool could just be making a joke, he could also be alluding to the fact that Lear is going crazy. A kibe could be a foreshadowing metaphor for Lear's brain because he reaches his craziest peak while standing outside in a cold, wet storm barefoot.
