Here we see Kent making the decision to disguise himself in order to watch over Lear in his banishment. From this moment onward, Kent speaks in prose in order to disguise himself. This also shows a dual consciousness that foils Edmunds. Throughout the play, Shakespeare plays with the idea that speaking in prose signifies wisdom. The na√Øve characters speak in verse. This verse drops when they are shown the truth. Kent is one of the first people to play with this idea that speaking in prose means he has more wisdom. Speaks to the dual consciousness.
