Yeoman OED-A servant or attendant in a royal or noble household, usually of a superior grade, ranking between a sergeant and groom or squire and page.
An important line because it hints at a lot of the questions that people were asking back then regarding how the king should be treated once he is not king anymore and has lost his power. Lear believes the madman which is him is still a king while the Fool say he is a mere servant.
