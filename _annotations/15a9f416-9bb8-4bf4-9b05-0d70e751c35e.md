These lines reinforce that Cordelia is young and probably unwise. The OED defines dowry as "2 The money or property which the wife brings to the husband" and Cordelia is the only in married daughter making dower something that she as concerned about in her young age. The repetition of "So young" really draws the audiences/readers attention to her age.
