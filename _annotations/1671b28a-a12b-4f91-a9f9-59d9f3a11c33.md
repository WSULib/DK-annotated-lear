This word choice is interesting because Lear uses it when he is cursing Regan (a time seen as Lear going mad). This could mean he will be "patient" and instead he will stay with his other daughter Goneril, or it could mean that he is an actual "patient" at like a hospital or asylum really embracing the idea that his is losing it.
