According to the OED, infirmity means "weakness or want of strength; lack of power to do something; inability." Which is revealing of how King Lear's eldest daughters truly feel about him. That he is powerless, especially after he split the kingdom. It is also defined as " a weakness, flaw, defect in a person's character."
