This song has similar words to the song that the Clown sings in *Twelfth Night or What You Will,* but the verse that the Fool uses is adjusted to fit Lear's madness and never appears in *Twelfth Night.* The words "He that has and a little tiny wit... Must make content with his fortunes fit" could be interpreted to mean that Lear must cope with the mess that he made when he divided the parts of the kingdom to his two evil daughters and banished the good daughter. The Fool could be urging Lear to clean up his mess.
