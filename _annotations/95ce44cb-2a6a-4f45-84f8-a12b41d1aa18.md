Courtney Mansor: I'd like to draw attention to this line, because to me it suggests that Cordelia felt as though her father would know of her true lover for him over her sisters, because of everything she's been through with him. This is conveyed to the audience as an aside. She may have expected her father to understand her intent by not saying anything and was her way of saying her actions are what show her love and not her words. This is conveyed through the word "ponderous". The first definition of the OED explains it is "having great weight," so this evidence that Cordelia could be saying that she her love is stronger than words. However the second definition in the OED states it could mean, "serious, important, profound." This suggests that Cordelia could also be saying her love for her father is deeper than her sisters, and will be something he understands, so this could be why she chooses to say nothing as well.
