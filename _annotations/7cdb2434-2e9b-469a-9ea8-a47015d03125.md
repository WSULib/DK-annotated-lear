Chelsea: According to the OED, upbraid means "to bring forward [...] as ground for censure or reproach." Lear still thinks that he has the authority/grounds to complain and order people around. This word highlights the fact that Lear wanted to divide his kingdom among his daughters yet still have the authority he had when he was king.
