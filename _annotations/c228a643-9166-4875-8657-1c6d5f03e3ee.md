This line is dramatically significant because it marks a turning point in Lear’s character. Before this part of the play, Lear has made a lot of mistakes. He disowned his favorite daughter Cordelia, believing instead that Regan and Goneril were telling the truth about their love for him. He also exiled Kent, his most loyal servant. Neither of these characters did anything wrong, but Lear was blind and stubborn, unable to see what was really going on in his life. Now powerless, and in the rain, Lear has an epiphany. He recognizes that he did not help his kingdom’s poor, and expresses grief for what he has done. At last, he owns up to one of his mistakes, and begins to see clearly now.
